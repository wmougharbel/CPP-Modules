## Module 00: Introduction to Classes and Objects in C++

This module provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of classes and objects in C++. Students learn how to create and use classes, encapsulate data, and implement basic object-oriented programming principles.

## Module 01: Pointers and References in OOP C++

Module 01 delves into the use of pointers and references in the context of object-oriented programming in C++. Topics include memory management, dynamic memory allocation, and the role of pointers in creating flexible and efficient code.

## Module 02: Constructors, Copy Constructors, Operator Overloads, and Destructors in C++

In this module, students learn about constructors, copy constructors, operator overloads, and destructors. These essential concepts contribute to building robust and effective C++ programs.

## Module 03: Inheritance and Diamond Trap in C++

Module 03 explores the concepts of inheritance and addresses the challenges associated with the diamond trap. The diamond trap refers to a specific problem that can arise when a class inherits from two classes, both of which in turn inherit from a common base class.

    B   C
     \ /
      D
```
Students learn how to design and implement class hierarchies and resolve common issues related to multiple inheritance.

## Module 04: Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, and Interface Classes in C++

This module covers advanced topics such as polymorphism, abstract classes, and interface classes. Students learn how to create flexible and extensible code using these powerful object-oriented programming concepts.

## Module 05: Exceptions in C++

Module 05 focuses on exception handling in C++. Students explore how to use exceptions to manage errors effectively and create robust applications with graceful error recovery mechanisms.

## Module 06: Static Casting, Reinterpret Casting, and Dynamic Casting in C++

This module introduces different types of casting in C++, including static casting, reinterpret casting, and dynamic casting. Students learn when and how to use each type of casting to ensure type safety and program correctness.

## Module 07: Template Functions and Template Classes in C++

Module 07 covers template functions and classes, allowing students to write generic and reusable code. This module emphasizes the power of C++ templates in creating flexible and efficient algorithms and data structures.

## Module 08: Templated Containers, Iterators, and Algorithms in C++

Building upon the knowledge gained in previous modules, Module 08 explores templated containers, iterators, and algorithms. Students learn how to use the Standard Template Library (STL) to implement common data structures and algorithms.

## Module 09: Containers in C++

The final module, Module 09, focuses specifically on various containers available in C++. Students learn about different container types, such as vectors, lists, and maps, and gain proficiency in choosing and using the appropriate container for different scenarios.
